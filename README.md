# Modelling-and-Predicting-Crop-Health-Using-Remote-Sensing-Data-and-Neural-Networks
Built a slightly more advanced ML model to predict crop healthiness , this time we used neural networks when building our model( with 3 layers).The accuracy of the model is 0.9090909361839294 which is way better than my ML random classification model.
